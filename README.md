The documentation has been moved into a Docusaurus! 

To reach it navigate to the docusaurus folder and you should see each article in their respective folders there. 

To run this locally. 

```
cd docusaurus
npm install
npm start
```

this will build a local server on localhost:3000 

If you want to create a new build, you can 

```
npm build
npm serve
```

This will show you what it looks like hosted!
