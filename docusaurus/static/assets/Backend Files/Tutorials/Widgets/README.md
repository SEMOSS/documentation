# Widgets Readme
Our team utilizes text widgets, default handles, custom click events, etc. in different ways. We have put together a repository of examples for you to leverage when needed. All examples work with the [Movies Database](https://repo.semoss.org/semoss-training/backend/-/tree/master/db)


## What files are included?

> Text Widget

Each text widget folder contains a different type of template and will have the following files available for download:

* HTML file which is the code to include in the text widget
* An image of the output
* Any queries if applicable
* The compiled pixel query

> Default Widget

Each default handle is a different template and will include the JSON file format used to generate the default handle
