> _The CFG AI App Library Homepage_

This page contains a list of sample apps that you can try out. Click on an app to launch it within your browser tab and start exploring!  
> **Note**
> Some of the sample apps may require you to request access to models before you can use them. Please see the **[Adding a Model to Your Catalog](../Get%20Started/Navigation/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough.mdx#adding-a-model)** guide for details on how to get access to a model.

Additionally, there are also 2 "system" apps called **BI** and **Terminal**:
* **BI**: A one-stop data analytics and visualization platform where you can build custom dashboards and share insights. For more guidance on this tool, please visit the [SEMOSS User Guide](https://SEMOSS.org/SemossDocumentation/).
* **Terminal**: An interactive command line/console where you can toggle the mode between **Pixel, Python, and CMD Shell** to execute scripts and run commands.
