## Generating Access and Secret Keys

To access the SEMOSS server, you need to create a user **Access Key** and **Secret Key** through the base application. The steps are as follows:

Navigate to the home screen of base application/App Library. Find the gear icon on the bottom-left side of the window. Click on it to go to Settings page.

Go to **'My Profile'** to access your user profile and click on **'Add New**' to create a new Access / Secret Key.

A **'Generate Access Key'** form will pop-up on your screen. Fill it out with the appropriate name and description and then click on **Generate**. Once you get the Access and Secret Keys, you MUST save/copy it locally.

> **Warning** > _This is the **ONLY TIME** that you will be able to see your Access Key and Secret Key. Once you close the out of pop-up, you will NOT be able to access them again. It is crucial that you record/copy the key values to a safe place, like a local .txt file or password manager, immediately after key creation._

> **Important** > _Please **do not share** your credentials with anyone_

These keys will be used to configure your SEMOSS SDK with access to the models, databases, and other resources associated with your account on the SEMOSS instance where your keys were generated.

### Next Steps

Now that you have explored the SEMOSS platform, you can start to develop your own apps. To do so, we recommend that you:

1. Set up your [front end development environment](Packages%20and%20Pre-requisites.md#front-end-prerequisities)
2. Optionally, set up your [SEMOSS back end](Packages%20and%20Pre-requisites.md#back-end-prerequisities) if you plan to create custom back end logic for your apps.
