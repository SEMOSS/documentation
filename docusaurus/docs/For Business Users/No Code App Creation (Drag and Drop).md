## Drag and Drop Blocks to Build UI for your new App

To build UI for a new app, we can Drag and Drop UI components to customize the app's design as per our requirement. We have different building blocks to design the app and add data to it.

Before starting let us first have a top level understanding of the app creation process. The overall process can be divided in 3 tabs- **UI**, **Notebook**, and **Variables**.
**UI tab**- Here, we drag and drop the UI elements to build our app design. This section defines how our app will look and what features and elements will it have for the user.
**Notebook tab**- Here we create requests to be made from the multiple app resources we have at our peril
**Variables tab**- Here connect the **UI tab** with the **Notebook tab**. Variables tab empowers us to enter an input (and hit a command) and the App will run through a relevant data repository and provide an output.

**Notebook** and **Variables** tabs combine to form the **Data tab**.
