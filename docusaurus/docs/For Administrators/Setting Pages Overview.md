In the Settings section, you have give or revoke access of any App, Model, Function, Database, Vector, or Storage of which you are an author.
You can even edit the type of access given to other practisioners, like changing the access from author to an editor or just a viewer.

## App Settings

When you click on the App Settings tab, you will see all the apps that are housed under the 'My Apps' section in your platform.

To change the access settings of any App, click on it. You will have to be an author of the app to edit the access settigs. If you are an author, you can either add members, revoke access from any existing members, or edit the access type.

## Removing an App from SEMOSS

If you ever want to remove an App from your SEMOSS server, the first thing that you should do is navigate to your settings sections (the gear).

![Settings Tool](../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/Settings%20Tool%20icon.PNG)

> _The settings tool_

Inside Settings, you should see a screen that has a settings sections for each of the resources you have in SEMOSS. Click on App Settings.

![App Settings](../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/CfGAI%20Settings_2.PNG)

> _This will house all the Gen AI apps that you have in your App Catalog_

Here you will see each of your apps listed individually. Click on the app that you would like to delete.

This process can be replicated for all other resource types (databases, models, storage catalogs, etc) in SEMOSS!

## Model, Function, Database, Vector, Storage Setting

Settings for all the resources works in the same way as it is for App Settings. The only difference is that in these 5 resource settings you will not find the 'Data Apps' tab. Apart from this, all features and functuality remains the same.
